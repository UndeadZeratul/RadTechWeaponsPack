* **Ammunition Code**: `s25`
  * A pistol-caliber carbine chambered in 10mm Auto and the trusted weapon of the UAC's Light Drop Infantry Division. Comes with a bayonet affixed by default for close-quarters engagements or can opening.

## Obrozz Sawn-Off Boss Rifle

  * An Obrez'd version of the Mk. IV Boss bolt-action rifle. A crude but deadly weapon, "Obrez" pistols were used by resistance members of the past for assasinations and self defense. The stock and barrel have been cut down to make one-handed firing possible, and its small size makes it easier to conceal than a full-length rifle.

  * `dot [0-5]` - Chosen reflex sight dot
* **Ammunition Code**: `450`
  * A 'jailbroken' model of the Volt ZM66 assault rifle. This weapon has been stripped of most of its 'less desirable' features, mainly being the magazine DRM system. The firerate is reduced and the ammo counter is non-functional, but most users give it a unique 4-round "Quad-Burst" firemode as a compromise.

* **Ammunition Code**: `930`
  * An old sub-machine gun designed and used by the British during WWII, known mostly for being problematic due to its jamming and overheating issues. This version has been modified with an integrally suppressed barrel, making its overall sound signature comparable to a handclap at best. Many compare it to the MP-46 SMG of today's time, though very few use it over that due to its many issues.

* **Ammunition Code**: `930`
  * A support weapon chambered in 9mm, takes standard UAC SMG magazines and can hold a total of 150+5 rounds, or 5 magazines plus a round chambered. Remember to hold onto empty magazines, they're a lot more expensive than 4mm ones.

* **Loadout Code**: `csg`
* **Ammunition Code**: `shl`
  * A compact shotgun often seen in the hands of space marines throughout the galaxy. Despite having no side saddles, or a butt stock to attach them to, in the right hands it's just as deadly as any other shotgun. Toss one in your pack the next time you leave base, it might become incredibly handy.

* **Ammunition Code**: `xsh`
  * The antithesis of the Less-Lethal Shotgun, this modified Hunter fires shells loaded with miniature HE grenade slugs, causing serious injuries and burns upon impact. Using this weapon in close quarters is usually ill-advised, as the slug's propellent may splash back at the user and burn them along with their target.

![Thumbnail](https://github.com/Gay-Snake-Squad/RTWP-ImageHosting/blob/main/Screenshots/explosiveshotgun.png)

### Explosive Shotgun Settings

## Single-Action Revolver

* **Actor Class**: `HDSingleActionRevolver`
* **Loadout Code**: `rsa`
* **Ammunition Code**: `45l`
  * An ancient firearm better suited for a cowboy than a space marine. Chambered in .45 Long COlt, this revolver will definitely punch a hole in whatever it hits. It has a much greater ricochet chance which makes it handy for bouncing rounds off walls to perform 'trickshots'.

![Thumbnail](https://github.com/Gay-Snake-Squad/RTWP-ImageHosting/blob/main/Screenshots/singleactionrevolver.png)

## Juan 9mm 'Horseshoe' Pistol

* **Actor Class**: `HDHorseshoePistol`
* **Loadout Code**: `jua`
  * `selectfire [0|1]` - whether it has a fire selector or not
  * `firemode [0|1]` - semi/auto, subject to the above
* **Ammunition Code**: `j30 | 915`
  * A variant of the standard-issue pistol, albeit with compatibility for a non-standard issue magazine. As the name suggests, it used to only use a unique "horseshoe" magazine that holds 30 rounds, though recent models have been modified to accept standard pistol mags. However, its small size makes it hard to control in full-auto mode, which experienced users remedy by using a "galloping" shooting pattern, firing in short, controlled bursts to stay on target.

## DM-93 Plasma Rifle

* **Actor Class**: `PlasmaBuster`
* **Loadout Code**: `d93`
* **Ammunition Code**: `bat`
  * A revised version of the "Thunder Buster" particle beam gun. After receiving a disturbing number of incident reports involving self-detonations caused by careless use of the Thunder Buster, UAC tasked a junior researcher with finding a solution to this problem. The answer was found when they tweaked the ion emitter so that the plasma particles are contained an electromagnetic field which holds it together until it impacts a target. This plasma has a smaller, but safer blast radius so direct contact is required to cause maximum damage. Automatic fire emits an accurate stream of projectiles, while burst-fire shoots out a spread of multiple shots intended for close-quarters encounters.
